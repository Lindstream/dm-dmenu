Dream Machine: dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

Modifications:
--------------------
* Fuzzy Matching & Levenshtein Distance  
  https://github.com/dcousens/dmenu-levenshtein

* Masked input  
  Really useful together with "sudo -A" 

* CenterX  
  Puts dmenu on center stage.

* CenterY  
  Respects lines-param and placement is calculated on desired height - not the resulting list.

* Width  
  Really great if you don't want dmenu spanning
  your entire screen width ;)

* Lineheight  
  To loosen things up!
