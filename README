Dream Machine: dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

Modifications:
--------------------
* Fuzzy Matching & Levenshtein Distance

* Masked input
  Really useful together with "sudo -A" 

* CenterX, CenterY
  Let's dmenu take the center stage

* Width
  Really great if you don't want dmenu spanning
  your entire screen width ;)

* Lineheight
  To loosen things up!
