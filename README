====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.

Modifications:

* Fuzzy Matching & Levenshtein Distance

* Masked input
  Really useful together with sudo -A 

* CenterX, CenterY
  Let's dmenu take the center stage

* Width
  Really great if you don't want dmenu spanning
  your entire screen width ;)

* Lineheight
